This model calculates combined transit light curves of all TRAPPIST-1 planets accounting for transit-timing variations (TTVs). 
You must add a start time (minimum 10, the first calculated transit time from Agol et al. 2021) and an end time (maximum 10, the last calculated transit time from Agol et al. 2021). 

This will calculate and combine the transit light curves from all TRAPPIST-1 planets according to the forecast transit times presented in Agol and al 2021. 

This tool can be used to provide observing windows for the planning of future follow-up observations of this system.

The predicted transit times and their uncertainties can be downloaded from the web page.
